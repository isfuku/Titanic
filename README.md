# Kaggle Titanic, regularized regression from scratch, and custom data viz in R

This repository implements regularized logistic regression from scratch, and applies it to kaggle's titanic competition. 

It also have some functions to auxiliate feature engineering and model evaluation.

The goal of this project was to learn more about regularized regression, and implementing it from scratch while applying to a well known dataset accomplish these goals.

To improve titanic competition public leaderboard performance, a better approach is to use other classification algorithms, more features and take advantage of data leakage.
