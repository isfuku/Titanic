# Titanic R code for Kaggle's Titanic Competition 

Contains file with functions to fit regularized linear regression, aswell as a scripit with data preparation, some vizualisation and learning curves to choose regularized regression optimal hyperparamter.

Here is my pramary code, but my best results was top 16%. If I could invest more time, I would try different learning algorithms and also try some more features (my best score did not use data leakage).
